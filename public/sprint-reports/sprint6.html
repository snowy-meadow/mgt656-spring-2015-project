<h3>Stories Completed</h3>
<p>We successfully completed all of the test last sprint. This sprint we focused on adding CSS to make the site look awesome. Below is some of the formatting we added:</p>
<p>1. Made the background image a high res concert photo. We made this change in style.css.</p>
<p>2. Made the text that is used throughout the site dark orange. This change was also made in style.css under container </p>
<p>3. Changed the opacity of our team logo. This change was made in index.html</p>
<p>We completed the following stories:</p>
<p>We did not complete any stories this sprint because we are working on making the site look good. We made progress on the story but will not fully complete it until the end of the project.</p>

<p>9) As any user, I can visit your site and it looks awesome</p>
<p>The plan for this sprint is to make each page (about us, event detail, etc...) look nice and formatted. We will leverage CSS to include new fonts, styles, colors, and overall formatting.</p>
<h3>Status of the app:</h3>
