<p>Stories Completed</p>
<p>We kicked ass during this sprint! We met twice as a team to structure and execute stories. The key for us was getting everyone into their own Cloud9 workspace. Prior to this sprint, we were all logged into Cloud9 via the same account (tmanvandy). Professor Muecke helped us sort through this issue. We realized that “sharing a workspace” greatly reduced our efficiency. After we solved this issue, we were able to make serious progress. We all now feel comfortable pulling and pushing to the master and deploying to Heroku. We followed Professor Jensen's online videos to help complete 3 stories.</p> 
<p>We completed the following stories:</p>
<p>     1. Should be using Bootstrap CSS</p>
<p>     2. The API</p>
<p>     3. The form for creating new events</p>
<p>Product Backlog</p>

<p>We have two stories left:</p>
<p>     6) As an attendee, I can visit the event detail page and RSVP for an event </p>
<p>     9) As any user, I can visit your site and it looks awesome</p>
<p>Status of the app:</p>
<p>Once we complete creating the event detail page, all the tests in mocha should pass. Completing the event detail page will be our key focus for the upcoming sprint. After the next sprint, our website will have all the required functionality and we can focus on making it aesthetically pleasing. </p>
<p>Below is the latest result form the mocha test. The 4 failures are related to the event detail page.</p>
<p>Executed 43 tests in 7 suites in 5s 697ms</p>
<p>39 passes</p>
<p>4 failed</p>
