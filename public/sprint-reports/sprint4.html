<p>Stories Completed</p>
<p>We kicked ass during this sprint! We met twice as a team to structure and execute stories. The key for us was getting everyone into their own Cloud9 workspace. Prior to this sprint, we were all logged into Cloud9 via the same account (tmanvandy). Professor Muecke helped us sort through this issue. We realized that “sharing a workspace” greatly reduced our efficiency. After we solved this issue, we were able to make serious progress. We all now feel comfortable pulling and pushing to the master and deploying to Heroku.</p> 
<p>We completed the following stories:</p>
<p>     1. Should be using Bootstrap CSS</p>
<p>     2. The API</p>
<p>     3. The form for creating new events</p>
