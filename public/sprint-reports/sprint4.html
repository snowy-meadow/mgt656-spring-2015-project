<h1>Sprint Completed Stories
None
We met together to lay out a plan for what the project will look like. We identified what the user stories would be for the project and then arranged the steps in order of difficulty (easy, medium, hard). We estimated what tasks would be required for each difficulty level and allocated story points based on this difficulty. Based on these point allocations, we assigned expected day lengths to each of the steps using 40 as the total. Ensuring the website looks awesome will run the duration of the project as we will have to recalibrate the website each time a new feature is added to make sure it is aesthetically appealing.
