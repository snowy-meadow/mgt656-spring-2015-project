<p>We are on day 30.</p>
<h3>Stories Completed</h3>
<p>We went into this sprint with the majority of the tests passing (37 of 43). However, after speaking with Greg Muecke, we realized this number was inaccurate. After looking "behind the hoodie,‚Äù we noticed that 10 tests under the form for creating new events section were green but were not actually completed. We spent this sprint completing these tests + the three tests under the event detail pages section. We successfully completed all of these tests, which means we executed 43 tests in 7 suites. We are now focusing on leveraging CSS to make our site look appealing.</p> 
<p>We completed the following stories:</p>
<p>3. The form for creating new events (had to re-do this story in this sprint)</p>
<p>6. As an attendee, I can visit the event detail page and RSVP for an event </p>

<p>We have one story left:</p>
<p>9) As any user, I can visit your site and it looks awesome</p>
<p>The plan for this sprint is to make each page (about us, event detail, etc...) look nice and formatted. We will leverage CSS to include new fonts, styles, colors, and overall formatting.</p>
<h3>Status of the app:</h3>
<p>We completed creating the event detail page, so all the tests in mocha pass. We can now focus on making the site look awesome. </p>
<p>Below is the latest result form the mocha test. All tests are passing!</p>
