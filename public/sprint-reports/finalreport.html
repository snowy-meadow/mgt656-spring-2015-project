<h3>Stories Completed</h3>
<p>We successfully completed all of the tests last sprint. This sprint we focused on adding CSS to make the site look awesome. We have also upgraded the formatting so that the site looks more professional by using borders and background images. We used Google Analytics to answer managementâ€™s questions regarding our traffic segmentation and optimal diction to improve click-through and conversion rates. Adding Google Analytics required trial and error but we were eventually able to get the code and scripts working.</p>
<p>We completed the following stories:</p>
<p>As any user, I can visit the site and it looks awesome. Below we attached a screenshot of our homepage.</p>

<p>All of the tests pass mocha, and the result is below. Beyond passing all of the mocha tests, we improved the aesthetics of the site, which now looks awesome! Moreover, we are now using Google Analytics to better manage the site.</p>
<h3>Status of the app:</h3>
