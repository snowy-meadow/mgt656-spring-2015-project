<h3>Business Intelligence Questions:</h3>
<p>95% of the visitors to our site were new. Below are the answers to the questions as well as screen shots of the Google Analytics tests.</p>
<h4>1. How your traffic breaks down across different segments and how they flow through your "funnel" from landing to donation.</h4>
<p>During the time period, we had 224 visitors to the site with 86% dropping off at the “Home” page. For those remaining their first interactions breakdown as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>72% “House Party” page</li>
<li>22% “About” page</li>
<li>3% “All Events” page</li>
<li>3% “Create New Event” page</li>
</ul>
<p>Those visitors whose first interaction was the “House Party” page, 52% dropped off and the remaining 42% had a second interaction with the site as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>82% returned to the “Home” page</li>
<li>18% visited the “Donation” page</li>
</ul>
<p>Those visitors whose first interaction was the “About” page, 29% dropped off and the remaining 71% had a second interaction with the site as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>60% returned to the “Home” page</li>
<li>40% visited the “House Party” page – of those, 50% donated and 50% dropped off</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. If making the event links on the home page include the word "RSVP" would increase click-through rate.</h4>
<p>To maximize the number of people who RSVP for our events, we tested the language used on our RSVP links. Our hypothesis was that adding “RSVP” to the event link would increase the click-through rate as it provides a clearer call-to-action for the visitor. We A/B tested the this “RSVP” link with the normal “non-RSVP” link, measuring click-through-rates for each. The results are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.97% conversion rate for the “non-RSVP” link</li>    
<li>5.28% conversion rate for the “RSVP” link</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the test validated our hypothesis that the “RSVP” would have a better click-through rate.</p>

</p>

<h4>3. If they should ask people to "donate" or "support" an event in the the donation link text to increase conversions.</h4>
<p>Beyond maximizing RSVP, we also want to motivate visitors to donate. We hypothesized that the word “support” would motivate more people to donate than the “donate” button because the word “support” engenders more of a sense of being a part of a community than “donate”. Our hypothesis was validated by an A/B test, with the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>5.71% conversion rate for “Donate”</li>
<li>18.18% conversion rate for “Support” </li>
</ul>
<p>Our hypothesis was validated by the test with “support” generating over a 3X conversion rate compared to “donate”.</p>

<p>We completed the project! We are on day 43 and have 0 stories points left.</p>
<h3>Stories Completed</h3>
<p>We successfully completed all of the tests last sprint. This sprint we focused on adding CSS to make the site look awesome. We have also upgraded the formatting so that the site looks more professional by using borders and background images. We used Google Analytics to answer management’s questions regarding our traffic segmentation and optimal diction to improve click-through and conversion rates. Adding Google Analytics required trial and error but we were eventually able to get the code and scripts working.</p>
<p>We completed the following stories:</p>
<p>As any user, I can visit the site and it looks awesome. Below we attached a screenshot of our homepage.</p>

<p>We have no stories left.</p>
<p>All of the tests pass mocha, and the result is below. Beyond passing all of the mocha tests, we improved the aesthetics of the site, which now looks awesome! Moreover, we are now using Google Analytics to better manage the site.</p>
<h3>Status of the app:</h3>
<p>We completed creating the event detail page, so all the tests in mocha pass. We can now use Google Analytics to monitor how successful future website variations are. </p>
<p>Below is the latest result form the mocha test. All tests are passing!</p>
